# Invoice-Generator-for-Hours-Tracker-App
A very simple invoice generator for the app "Hours Tracker" for IOS. Converts your hours into an invoice in .docx and .pdf format.

Yes I had help from ChatGPT, however this was not fully generated by it and is heavily tweaked to the requirement it as made for originally.

## Steps:

- Create Folder and put invoicegen.py in the folder
- Put the extracted CSV in the same folder
- Within the code, change "[name.csv]" to the name of your CSV
- Run the code
- ???
- Profit
